When we ran minikube, we had to create secrets like pgpassword into local k8s cluster by running 'kubectl create ...' (imperatively).

In gcloud prod enviroment, we have to create the same to prod cluster.

- first, bring up gcloud shell window so that when we run kubectl inside the shell, it issues to our prod cluster in google cloud.
- configure gcloud shell window to set gcloud project, compute zone (geo location), cluster creadentials 'multi-cluster'
- now use kubectl in the shell to create scecret:
 kubectl create secret generic pgpassword --from-literal PGPASSWORD=mypgpassword123
  
Now we can use pgpassword in k8s deployment files.
